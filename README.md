Welcome to a War Eagle tradition!

This Auburn University tradition began after World War 2 when soldiers returning to the University felt disconnected from their fellow students.
To welcome them back into the Auburn family, Auburn created a day where everyone would wear name tags and say "Hey!" to each other.
This tradition reunited the Auburn University students and created a stronger sense of community.
So, from an Auburn graduate, Hey! I'd love to know your name. Please run the script to get involved in an act of kind-hearted human interaction.

For more information, here's the SGA page promoting this tradition. http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/

As always, War Eagle!
